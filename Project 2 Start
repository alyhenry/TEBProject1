Construction was going smoothly until one day, a rather costly error was made.
The crew did not account for the depth of the pipe, so when digging down, the jammed into half of it.
From there, they had to decide the best course of action.
The maintenence crew decided to make a clean break down the middle.
And with a resounding "THUD", the pipeline was cut in half.
The water and gas had to be shut down in the entire school.
The Freshman in Mitty had it the worst. 
They had no water for 2 days and were focred to shower at the rec center. 
Needless to say, commuter students were happy to live off campus that week.
Construction continued for 2 weeks, with yellow tape blocking off areas of work.
Students got used to the constant sounds of contruction through class. 
Maintence was sending email updates every day to let students know what was happening.
Finally, the gas line was fixed and everyone had water and energy again.
